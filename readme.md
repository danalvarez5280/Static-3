This is my final Static Comp Project. It has responsive widths for all mobile devices. The left navigation bar will kick up to the top and one by one all the elements become display block. It makes the site feel like it has a natural transition to a mobile device. All buttons have a hover state with a cursor changing into a pointer. This project was difficult due due the small details. I believe I got all of them, maybe hacked together a few but all in all it looks the same as the site.
